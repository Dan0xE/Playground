# Playground

Playground is a universal launcher application that acts as a centralized hub for all my personal GitHub projects. This React-based app provides an intuitive interface to browse, interact with, and launch my unique projects, like Nevo. Plus, it allows you to download, install, and update them directly from the interface.

## Features

- **Intuitive Navigation:** Easily browse and launch any of my GitHub projects.
- **Download & Install:** Download and install my projects like Nevo directly from the interface.
- **Automatic Updates:** Keeps the installed apps up to date with the latest versions.
